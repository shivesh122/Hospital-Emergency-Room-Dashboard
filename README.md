# Hospital Emergency Room Data Analysis  

This project is a **self-learning initiative** by me, focused on analyzing **Hospital Emergency Room (ER) data** using **data visualization and analytics techniques**. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and insights from ER data that can help in understanding patient flow, emergency case distribution, and resource management.  

---

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Import and clean raw ER data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identify patterns in patient visits (time, age, gender, severity, etc.)  
- Build meaningful data visualizations for better interpretation  
- Generate insights that can support hospital decision-making  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (Data extraction and cleaning)  
- **Power BI / Tableau / Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas)** for visualization & analysis  
- **Excel** (initial data exploration, if needed)
